# üìö Library Management System

A simple Python-based Library Management System (LMS) that allows users to manage books in a library. Users can add new books, search for books, borrow books, and return them. This system is designed to be lightweight and uses basic Python data structures like lists and dictionaries.

## üöÄ Features

- **Add a Book**: Users can input a book‚Äôs title and author to add it to the library.
- **Search for a Book**: Users can search for a book by title to check if it‚Äôs available in the library.
- **Borrow a Book**: Users can borrow a book if it‚Äôs available, and the system will track the borrowed books.
- **Return a Book**: Users can return borrowed books, which will be made available in the library again.
- **Interactive Menu**: Provides an easy-to-use command-line interface for user interaction.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Data Structures
1. **`library_books` (list)**: Stores all the books available in the library. Each book is represented by a dictionary with the keys `title` and `author`.
2. **`borrowed_books` (dictionary)**: Tracks the borrowed books, with the book title as the key and the name of the borrower as the value.

### Functions
1. **`add_book(book_title, author)`**: Adds a new book to the library.
2. **`search_book(book_title)`**: Searches for a book in the library by title.
3. **`borrow_book(book_title, user_name)`**: Allows a user to borrow a book if available.
4. **`return_book(book_title)`**: Allows a user to return a borrowed book.
5. **`library_menu()`**: Displays a menu for user interaction and processes their choices.

## üíª Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
   cd library-management-system
   ```

2. **Run the program**:
   You can run the system directly using Python:
   ```bash
   python library_management_system.py
   ```

3. **Interactive Menu**: 
   Once the program starts, the interactive menu will prompt you to select an option:
   ```plaintext
   Library Menu:
   1. Add a Book
   2. Search for a Book
   3. Borrow a Book
   4. Return a Book
   5. Exit
   ```

## üìù Usage

1. **Add a Book**: Choose option `1`, then enter the book title and author.
2. **Search for a Book**: Choose option `2` and enter the title of the book you're looking for.
3. **Borrow a Book**: Choose option `3`, enter the title of the book, and provide your name.
4. **Return a Book**: Choose option `4` and enter the title of the book you‚Äôre returning.
5. **Exit**: Choose option `5` to exit the program.

### Example

```plaintext
Library Menu:
1. Add a Book
2. Search for a Book
3. Borrow a Book
4. Return a Book
5. Exit
Enter your choice (1-5): 1
Enter the book title: Kifo Kisimani
Enter the author: Wallah Bin Wallah
Book "Kifo Kisimani" by Wallah Bin Wallah added to the library.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: Core language for the Library Management System.

## üìà Future Enhancements

- **Multiple Copies**: Track multiple copies of the same book.
- **User Authentication**: Add user registration and login features.
- **Persistent Storage**: Use a database (e.g., SQLite) to store books and users permanently.
- **Graphical Interface**: Create a GUI for a better user experience using Tkinter or PyQt.
